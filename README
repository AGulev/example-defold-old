This Defold project contain a set of examples that illustrate various concepts and aspects
of Defold development. Each example is contained within a separate folder and there is a
main menu interface (under folder "main") that present a GUI interface to the examples and
allows the user to select which example to run.

These are the examples:

Magic

Cards

HUD

Worlds

Lifecycle

Input

Modules
=======
This example shows how to share code through the use of a Lua module. The module stores some data
internally which is a potential source of coupling between the users of the module.

Behaviors
=========
This example implements a simple flight behavior for butterflies (and other flying critters) in
three different manners.

Blue butterflies	Use a Lua module that contains animation behavior and stores data internally

Yellow butterflies	Interact with a GO that implements the behavior totally decoupled from the user

Green butterflies	Are controlled by an autonomous game object that implements the behavior and stores
					data internally
