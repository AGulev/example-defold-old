This Defold project contain a set of examples that illustrate various concepts and aspects
of Defold development. Each example is contained within a separate folder and there is a
main menu interface (under folder "main") that present a GUI interface to the examples and
allows the user to select which example to run.

These are the examples:

And here are some more examples.

Magic
=====
This example illustrates message passing as a means of communicating between objects in a game or app.

Cards
=====
This example illustrates URL:s and paths, child-parent vs. collection-object hierarchies. See the
"Message passing" documentation.

HUD
===
This example shows a simple HUD implementation with a controller object. See the "HUD" documentation.

Worlds
======
This example implements a very simple streaming setup using collection proxies and triggers. See the
"Collection proxies" documentation.

Lifecycle
=========
This example runs through a full lifecycle of an application. Each step on the way is logged through
a console printout so you can study it in parallel to the code.

Input
=====
This example illustrates how to handle touch and keyboard (text) input. It implements a pause menu
that consumes input to shift input focus dynamically.

Modules
=======
This example shows how to share code through the use of a Lua module. The module stores some data
internally which is a potential source of coupling between the users of the module.

Behaviors
=========
This example implements a simple flight behavior for butterflies (and other flying critters) in
three different manners.

Blue butterflies	Use a Lua module that contains animation behavior and stores data internally

Yellow butterflies	Interact with a GO that implements the behavior totally decoupled from the user

Green butterflies	Are controlled by an autonomous game object that implements the behavior and stores
					data internally

Physics
=======
This example is a simple implementation of a platformer with slopes. There are some dynamic physics
objects in addition to the character. Note that there are some edge cases that causes glitches and 
unwanted side effects in the player movement, particularly at slope edges. These have been left as 
an exercise for you to track down and solve.
